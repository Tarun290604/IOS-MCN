    <description><![CDATA[
      This measurement provides the average UE throughput in downlink. 
      This measurement is intended for data bursts that are large enough to 
      require transmissions to be split across multiple slots. The UE data 
      volume refers to the total volume scheduled for each UE regardless if 
      using only primary- or also supplemental aggregated carriers. The 
      measurement is optionally split into subcounters per QoS level (mapped 
      5QI or QCI in NR option 3) and subcounters per supported S-NSSAI.
